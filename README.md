I analyze the OJ dataset by SVM. This problem involves the OJ data set in the  ISLR package. We are interested in the prediction
of “Purchase”. Divide the data into test and training. (A) Fit a support vector classifier with varying cost parameters over the
range [0.01, 10]. Plot the training and test error across this spectrum of cost parameters, and determine the optimal cost. (B)
Repeat the exercise in (A) for a support vector machine with a radial kernel. (Use the default parameter for gamma). Repeat the
exercise again for a support vector machine with a polynomial kernel of degree =2. Reflect on the performance of the SVM with 
different kernels, and the support vector classifier, i.e., SVM with a linear kernel.You can get the OJ data set from ISLR 
package of R.
